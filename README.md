I would like to share my very first big project I finished on June 2019. I was assigned with my co-student: Stamatis Spagadoros to create a Robotic Arm in University of Piraeus of Applied Sciences under the guidance of our teacher Makis Xatzopoulos. It's purpose was to give it 3 dimensions (x, y, z, in cm) and be able to reach those 3 dimensions.



In order to create the Robotic Arm we had to do the following:

-Design the Robotic Parts in 3D Using AutoCAD or similar software to be able to print them in 3D Printers, Cura Lulzbot Taz 4 was used using PLA.

-Design the Electronic Circuit in order for the Robotic Arm to behave as it is expected and avoid short circuit or failure

-Write the code in C using Arduino IDE

-Create a manual with Table of Contents explaining everything.



It took us many hours but we finally did it and we are proud of our creation.

We had to use our imagination, analyze, combine mathematics & trigonometry in coding and there was lots of trial and error in order for it to work and we have involved in imagination, intuition, process thinking.

On this repository you can find: 
- The manual we have created
- some images of our Robotic Arm
- The code written in C using Arduino IDE
